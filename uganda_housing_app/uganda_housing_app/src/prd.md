**Visual Metaphors**: Clean architectural lines, warm earth tones reflecting Uganda's landscape, and clear hierarchical information presentation.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes content and functionality over decoration.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Complementary with Ugandan cultural references

**Primary Color**: Uganda flag red (oklch(0.55 0.2 15)) - communicates strength and reliability for primary actions
**Secondary Colors**: Warm neutral (oklch(0.94 0.02 60)) for secondary actions
**Accent Color**: Uganda flag yellow (oklch(0.75 0.15 85)) - optimistic and welcoming for highlights
**Color Psychology**: Red builds trust and urgency, yellow adds warmth and optimism, neutrals provide calm professionalism

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary text on background: oklch(0.15 0.03 240) on oklch(0.98 0.01 60) - WCAG AA compliant
- Primary button text: oklch(0.98 0.01 60) on oklch(0.55 0.2 15) - WCAG AA compliant
- Secondary text: oklch(0.45 0.03 240) on oklch(0.96 0.02 60) - WCAG AA compliant

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with strategic weight variations for clarity and consistency
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings, medium subheadings, regular body text with 1.5x line height
**Font Personality**: Inter provides modern professionalism with excellent readability across devices
**Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
**Legibility Check**: Inter tested for clarity at small sizes on mobile devices

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Property images lead, followed by price and location, then details and actions
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates calm browsing experience and highlights important information
**Grid System**: Responsive grid adapting from single column on mobile to 3-column on desktop
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary (contact buttons), secondary (view details), tertiary (save/share)

### UI Elements & Component Selection
